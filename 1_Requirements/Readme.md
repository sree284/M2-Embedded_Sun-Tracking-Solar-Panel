Introduction:
   
  As the non renewable energy resources are decreasing, use of renewable resources for producing electricity is increasing. Solar panels are becoming more popular day by day.Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery.This energy can be utilized when required or can be used as a direct alternative to the grid supply. Utilization of the energy stored in batteries is mentioned in below given applications.The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent.This can be done only if the panels are continuously placed towards the direction of the Sun. So, solar panel should continuously rotate in the direction of Sun. 
    
Research:
 
   The sun is regarded as the source of energy for its constant duration and hygenic state, and its remarkable efficiency of not polluting the environment, as other kinds of energy like coal and the derivations of oil that cause the pollution of atmosphere and environment.This requires from us a detailed study to deeper our knowledge in its different usage.
 
 Features:
  
  Increase Solar Panel Output.
  
  Maximum efficiency of the panel.
  
  Maximize power per unit area.
  
  Able to grab the energy through out the day.
  
  
 4W and 1H:
  
WHEN:

With solar tracking, it will become possible to generate more energy since the solar panel can maintain a perpendicular profile to the rays of the sun. 

WHO:

Solar power is harnessed using Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technology that converts sunlight (Solar radiation) into electricity by using semiconductors. When the sun hits the semiconductor within the PV cell, electrons are freed and bus bars collect the running electrons which results in electric current.

WHY:

A solar tracking system maximizes your solar system's electricity production by moving your panels to follow the sun throughout the day, which optimizes the angle at which your panels receive solar radiation. The narrower the angle of incidence, the more energy a photovoltaic panel can produce.


WHERE:

Solar trackers are devices used to orient photovoltaic panels, reflectors, lenses or other optical devices toward the sun. Since the sun's position in the sky changes with the seasons and the time of day, trackers are used to align the collection system to maximize energy production.

HOW:

Assemble the circuit as described and upload the code to ATmega328 Microcontroller.
Power on the circuit and place the set up directly under the Sun (on the rooftop).
Based on the light falling on the two LDRs, the ATmega328 Microcontroller changes the position of the Servo Motor which in turn moves in the panel.



SWOT ANALYSIS:

Strengths:

  Renewable Energy Source	

  Reduces Electricity Bills	

  Diverse Applications	

  Low Maintenance Costs	

  Technology Development


Weakness:

  Cost

  Weather dependent

  Solar Energy storage is expensive

  Uses a lot of space

  Associated with pollution


Opportunities:

  Solar trackers generate more electricity than their stationary counterparts due to an increased direct exposure to solar rays.


Threats:

  Location & Sunlight Availability.

  Solar Panels use a large amount of space.

  The Sun isn't always present.

  Solar Energy is Inefficient.

  There is an overlooked Pollution & Environmental Impact.

  Expensive Energy Storage.

  High Initial Cost.



High Level Requirements:

  The solar energy can be reused as it is non-renewable resource.

  This also saves money as there is no need to pay for energy used (excluding the initial setup cost)

  Helps in maximizing the solar energy absorption by continuously tracking the sun.



Low Level Requirements:

  Though solar energy can be utilized to maximum extent this may create problems in rainy season.

  Although solar energy can be saved to batteries, they are heavy and occupy more space and required to change time to time.

  They are expensive.
